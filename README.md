Project Description
-------------------

Designing and developing a method for processing vision data into commands for motion control for autonomous soccer playing robot.
Autonomous robots are robots that can perform various designated tasks by understanding the environment without continuous human guidance. 
There will be 2 Spark V robots, one goal-keeper and one striker. 
The striker will be human controlled whereas, goal keeper would be fully autonomous.
The striker will try to make a goal and the goal-keeper will try to defend it by moving in the way of the striker.
